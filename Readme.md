# Power BI Dashboards

This repository contains my Power BI dashboards and related source data. It's a central place where I keep dashboard files, sample/exported data, and notes for dashboards I build and maintain.

## Included projects

- `Expense-Dashboard/` — raw data and any files for the Expense dashboard (contains `Raw_Data.csv`).
- `Sales-Dashboard/` — sales dashboard file(s) (example: `sales_dashboard.pbip`).

## How to use

- Open the Power BI Desktop (`.pbix` or `.pbip`) files directly in Power BI Desktop to view or edit the dashboards.
- Use the CSV files in each project folder as source data when refreshing or rebuilding dashboards.

## Notes

- This repo is a personal collection of dashboards. Back up your PBIX/PBIP files before making large changes.
